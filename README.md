Lab 7.1: In this lab assignment we had to make an X shape with atleast 15 squares. We had to use loops to make this work.
I had an easy time making the first diagonal line that went from the top right to the bottom left, but it took 
me a while to figure out and understand the opposite line. My problem was I was making it more complicated than
it needed to be

Lab 7.2: In this lab assignment we needed to re-create our first assignment of making a 5x5 grind, BUT we needed to
use a nested loop to do it a lot faster. I made a grid with a pink gradient. I figured out the grid part pretty eas-
ily using the techniques I learned in the previous assignment. I wasn't able to figure out the gradient part in the
actual lab, but later I figured that I can use RGB values and muliply them by the variable in the loop.

Lab 7.3: In this lab assignment we needed to copy Lab 7.2 and added an instance of interactivity with the mouse.
We could change the shapes, the gradient, or anything that involved the mouse. I made the pink gradient change 
from pink to green with a mouse click. As I did with 7.2, I did this one outside of class and because of 
that I couldn't figure out how to make the colors change inside the loop. After with struggling with this for 
awhile, I went to look at other students work on Lab 7.3. I refrenced Evan Soucy's code to see how they made the
mouseisPressed work. I figured out that I had to add a function for mousePressed() that made the variable
pinkColor = !pinkColor and redraw(). After implemnting this code, it worked, I just had to fiddle with the RGg values
to make it work.
